SCREENSHOT OR DEMO:
Screenshots: These are static images that capture specific views or screens of your project. You take screenshots to show how your project looks and works at different stages or from different perspectives. Screenshots can be used to illustrate the user interface, design, and various features of your project.

Demo (Live Demo): A live demo refers to a functioning version of your project that users can interact with in real-time. It allows people to experience your project firsthand by navigating through its interface and testing its features. A live demo is especially valuable when you want to showcase the actual functionality of your project.

In the context of documentation, including screenshots or a link to a live demo is beneficial because:

It provides a visual representation of your project, helping readers understand how it looks and how it's used.
It allows users or stakeholders to get a feel for the project's user interface and overall design.
It demonstrates the project's functionality and features in action, which can be more informative than a textual description alone.
It adds credibility and transparency to your documentation or presentation by showing that your project is real and functional.
